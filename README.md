Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users

My first Kaggle competition. Starting ths repository with my first submit. Still have a lot things to improve, but think that`s already a good start =)

At this time i`m using only DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor. As an environment I used Jupyter Notebook.
